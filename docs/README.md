The NADA team is part of Tjenesteplattform and is focused on delivering infrastructure and tools for dataplattform and 
analysis platform in NAV. Our purpose is to:

* simplify the process of delivering data products for teams and contribute to realizing the [data mesh](concepts/data-mesh) vision i NAV.
* simplify working with advanced analysis and machine learning for analysts and data scientists.

Our operational goals are to make it easy to share and use data across product areas and outside of NAV.

We believe that:

* everything can and should be defined in code and under revision control
* it should only be one source of truth for analytical questions
* DataOps - use the same principals for DevOps as for software development

### Bets (Lean Value Tree)

We bet that:

* Datamesh thinking will make it easier to share and use data.
* Analysts will become more productive if they can use the Google AI platform combined with tools that provide easy and secure access to data as well as built-in privacy and compliance.
* NAV will be more data-driven if it is easy for decision-makers to obtain relevant data presented in a good way.


### Measurable Goals

#### Main goal

Amount of multidiciplinary team that delivers data as a product.

#### Secondary goals

-	Number of views and downloads from the data catalog website.
-	Amount of data products published
-	How many people uses the Google AI platform and other tools (Can be measured in the number of registered users, and/or license costs.)

#### Possible relevance in the future.

-	Map out how difficult it is for a team to deliver data products
-	Develop a service where you can subscribe and be notified to structural changes to the data. Measurable goals will then be the number of subscribers.
